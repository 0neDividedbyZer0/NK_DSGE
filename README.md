# NK_DSGE
NK DSGE models stands for New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Models. These are the current models in use for macroeconomic forecasting and policy design, including at the New York Fed: https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/dsge#/overview The main difference is that this will be written in Python to be amenable to reinforcement learning and other such tools. In particular, we will be exploring the use of inverse reinforcement learning to improve the macroeconomic predictions, since ACE models are still too computationally infeasible for macroeconomics.

This is the final project for CS 285 at Berkeley, Deep Reinforcement Learning
